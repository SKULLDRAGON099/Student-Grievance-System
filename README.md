### Idea 
<p> We are looking for a Students Grievance Support System. Expectations from software solution/web app
are: </p>  
<ul>
<li>It must be an easy access application, accessible to students, members of Student Grievance Redressal Committees, respective heads.</li>
<li>Students should be able to post complaints under different categories, Department Level, Institute/College Level and University Level. Again these categories would be sub divided among sub categories such as Admission, Finance, Examination, Lecture Timetable/Learning , Paper Re Evaluation, etc.</li>
<li>  Members of Students Grievance Redressal Committee should be able to sort complains based on keywords.</li>
<li> The Portal should link students with respective Department/Institutions/College and University Students Grievance Redressal Committees.</li>
<li> The student gets the notification whether the complaint is IN PROCESS or it has been CLOSED by the Admin ON Dashboard.</li>
<li> Student needs to check the complaint status whereas Admin needs to check the complaint regularly to see whether new complaint has been filed or not. </li>
</ul>
